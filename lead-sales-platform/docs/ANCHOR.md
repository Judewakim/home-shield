This repository contains authoritative business specifications.

The file
docs/behavior/lead_classification_and_inventory.md
is a behavioral contract.

All future code you generate must:

- conform exactly to the behavior defined in that document
- not introduce new rules, flags, or shortcuts
- not infer missing behavior

If a request would violate or extend the behavior contract, you must stop and ask for clarification.

Where ambiguity exists, the written specification prevails over code, comments, or tests.

Acknowledge this constraint before continuing.
